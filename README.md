#Ec2_Lambda_Monitoring_Provisions

Outline:
    The finished repository's goal will be to provide a conditional script to launch separate monitoring stacks
    defined as CloudFormation templates containing respective monitoring/tracing for Lambda Functions and Ec2 Instances. These stacks will 
    set up automated compute service discovery for monitoring provisions setup with event response.
